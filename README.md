Some basic neural network functionality that I made for classes that I undertook while interning at [Evolve Robot Lab](https://evolverobot.in/), Chennai.

The file 'CNN Code' is a CNN that utilises MNIST digits classification dataset, and shows the accuracy and loss in the model.

The file 'CNN Cose 2' is a CNN that utilises Fashion MNIST dataset and performs the same functions.

The file 'RNN' is an RNN that utilises MNIST dataset to create Bidirectional RNN, with an LSTM layer.

The file 'Image classification with tensorflow' performs image classification using Keras on Tensorflow's flowers dataset.
